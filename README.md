# UART-Transmitter-Receiver
SystemVerilog-based UART TX/RX project with testbenches and simulation using ModelSim


## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Fully synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL
- ✅ Implements UART protocol (start bit, 8-bit data, stop bit)
- ✅ Verified via testbenches with realistic stimuli
- ✅ Loopback test confirms end-to-end data transfer

## 📌 Tools Used

- **ModelSim** – Simulation and waveform verification
- **SystemVerilog** – RTL design and testbenches

## 📸 Simulation Snapshots

Screenshots of waveform results included under `SIM/`.
